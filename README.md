# VulkanTutorial

This solution assumes:
1. VulkanSDK v1.2.141.2 is installed to C:\VulkanSDK\1.2.141.2
2. GLFW v3.3.2 is installed to C:\GLFW\glfw-3.3.2
3. GLM v0.9.9.8 is installed to C:\GLM\glm-0.9.9.8

To do: Change the above assumptions such that the Visual Studio solution uses environment variables to determine the locations of the dependencies (libs, headers, etc).
